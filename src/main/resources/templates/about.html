  <p><b>About the Trust Act</b></p>
<p>The Trust Act was passed in several U.S. states, including Connecticut, and it prevents local and state law enforcement from arresting immigrants if federal immigration agencies ask them to do it unless they have a warrant with the judge’s signature. They’re also limited in giving info to federal immigration agencies like the immigrant's personal info. In summary, it helps innocent immigrants from being held in camps or deported from federal immigration agencies like ICE.</p>

<p><b>History of Connecticut’s Trust Act</b></p>
<p>The Trust Act was first passed in 2013.</p>
<p>It later was strengthened in 2019 to include more protections and reduce ICE access.</p>
<p>Currently, it was last changed in 2019, however, activists are pushing for stronger enforcement to avoid loopholes in how law enforcement can work with federal immigration agencies</p>
